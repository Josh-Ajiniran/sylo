Welcome to the new Sylo Text Search File Framework

Are you conducting a Reverse ENgineering or Code Review and
you need to search a specific string or text in a large folder with millions of subfolders
That is, you would like to know all the folders where "Credit Card: 2345555545" can be found in your folder...

Then Sylo is your best option to sort through possibly thousands of folders and files...
grepping specific user-defined search string....

Welcome to a new world of search....

Sylo is developed with an open community and frequent fixes, updates and upgrades...
You can participate in the project via GitHub www.github.com/propenster/sylo

Who this Framework is for:
======================================
Sylo is designed due to a dire need during one of the author's work in 2019

Propenster was reviewing the code of a particular android app he was working on
kinda like reverse engineering,
he needed to search for specific strings among the hundreds of .java files in the over 20
subfolders...
THEN Sylo was born... out of a developer's need.....

Developers:
Olusegun Faith Emmanuel,
Ajiniran Joshua Oluwasegun...
